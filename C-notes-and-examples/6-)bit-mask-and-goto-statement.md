## Bit Masks
- A bit mask is data that is used for bitwise operations 
- A mask can be used to set multiple bits in a byte to either on, off or inverted from on to off using a single bitwise.
- Bit masking allows you to use the C bitwise operators to manipulate the bits of an integer. 
- Checking if particular bit values are present or not.

**Using Bit Operators to Pack Data**

- You can pack information into the bits of a byte if you do not need to use the entire byte to represent the data. 
- Flags that are used for a boolean true or false condition can be represent in a single bit on a comp.
- unsigned int packedData;

 ## goto Statement
 - goto statement causes program control to jump to a particular line of code in your program.
 - This branch is made immidiately and unconditionally upon execution of the goto. 
 - to identify where in the program the branch is to be made, a label is needed.
