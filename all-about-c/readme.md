**C99 Standarts**

 - Bool data type (stdbool.h)
 - Variable length arrays 
 - Single line comments (//)
 - Some compiler improvements
 C89: int i ; for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
 C99: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)

**C11 Standarts**

 - Multithreading support (Defines a memory model that better suits multithreading)
 - Safer standart libraries
 - Better compliance with other industry standarts.
 - A new set of safer standart functions that aim to replace the unsafe function.
 - Removal of *gets* function
 - C has supported multithreading for decades however, all the popular C threading libraries have thus far been non-standart extensions, and hence non-portable
 - C11 header file <threads.h> (for creating and managing the threads)
 
 **(*#*)** Programmers usually start designing a program by dividing the problem into easily managed sections.
 
**Makefiles**

If you still want to work from the command line, the makefile utility is a tool that you might want to learn how to use it.

 - Makefile defines the set of source files.
 - Makefile defines the corresponding set of object files.
 - Makefile defines the name of executable
