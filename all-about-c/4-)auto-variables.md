## Auto Variables
C provides four storage classes, indicated by their storage class specifiers.

- auto
- register 
- extern 
- static

The four storage class specifiers can be split into two storage durations 

- Automatic storage duration
- Static storage duration

**Local Variables**
-
Local variables are declared within a function body or block of code.
Local variables have automatic storage duration by default.
**(*)** The C compiler assumes by default that any variable defined inside a function automatic local variable

**External Variables**
-
- The extern storage class simply tell us that a variable is defined elsewhere (not within the same block where it used)
- The main purpose of using extern variables is that they can be accessed between two different files which are part of a large program.
- Function contained in seperate files can communicate through external variable 
- extern int numb; -- The value of numb can now be accessed and modified by the module in which the preceding declaration appears.
- Other modules can also access the value of numb.

#include <stdio.h>
int i = 5;
void foo (void);
int main(){
printf("%i\n",i);
foo();
printf("%i", i);
return 0;
}
extern int i ;
void foo(void){
    i = 100;
}
